# Simple-AI-Chat-Bot
This AI Chat bot accepts a set of predefined questions as inputs, and provides a corresponding answer. This is done on the platform of Python, with utilization of applications like CMD and modules like NLTK and PyTorch. Using a basic neural network and running prediction algorithms on the ChatBot model, we can automate responses to given commands.
